Heatsum
Sum up the average or mean? value of each day in the growing season

For every 100 meters above sea level, add remove .7C from temperature


Yearly rainfall (årsnedbør)

Only calculate the rainfall in the growing season (but in some cases the rainfall before the growing season is important to store water for later dry periods)
Sum up mm rain each day - typically for a number of years - then average the sum to get a more typical value
